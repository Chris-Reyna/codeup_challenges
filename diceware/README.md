# Diceware

In 1995, technology author Arnold G. Reinhold came up with one of the mostly highly regarded schemes for developing secure passwords: [diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html). The problem with most passwords is that they are based off of a single word which an attacker can easily guess, or it's based on a series of random characters with we as humans have trouble remembering. Diceware solves these problems but creating passphrases with multiple random words or phrases so they are both difficult to guess but easy to remember.

Mr. Reinhold published a list of 7,776 words (included in this directory). These words are index by a series of five digit numbers, consisting of the digits 1 - 6. Using this, a person would roll five dice to generate an index and lookup a unique word on the list. The person could then do this as many times as he or she wished to generate their passphrase (5 words was generally considered to be proficient, having security roughly comparable to a password with 11 random characters).

Your task is to automate this process. Your user will tell the application how many words she wants to generate (using either `$argv` or `fgets(STDIN)`), your application will then ingest `diceware.wordlist.txt` and generate as many indexes as the user requested. Using those indices the program will lookup the relevant words and then output them out to the user before exiting.
